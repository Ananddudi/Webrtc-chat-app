Hey,

This is web chat application deployed on subdomain of render.com. It has all best practices to build large production ready application for companies such as secure cookie lever of token management, New url based form handling, <b>LIVE</b> video chat one to one, Sending real time messages with video,audio,image in chunks,Sending emails using nodemailer used gmail as SMTP service, Handling asynchronous tasks with react-query, Socket.io implementation with real time communication,handshake and much more.  

Site is live on <a href="https://web-chat-9hur.onrender.com/">RENDER</a> but since it is deployed on free domain the dynos or instance of render will be shutdown after 50 seconds inactivity. so you may need to wait until dynos up and running again</br>

Have a nice day :)
