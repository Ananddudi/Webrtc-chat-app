Site is live on <a href="https://web-node-chat.vercel.app/">vercel</a> but since vercel's serveless functions does not support socket connections but <a href="https://web-chat-9hur.onrender.com">Render</a> (Please wait until dyno up and running again. will take some time at first) works with socket despite of 5 min active dyno times.</br> 
It is working fine on local setup. <b>main</b> branch config to vercel but <b>Development</b> branch will do the job for local testing.
